%    "Probabilistic saliency estimation", Pattern Recognition, vol. 74, pp. 359-372, 2018
%
%   Inputs: 
%   image_now: RGB, double, RGB image (range between 0,255)
%   suppix_size: expected squareroot of a superpixel area
%   m: SLIC regularizer between spatial and color features
%   bkg: if 1, runs a robust background estimation algorithm, else takes the image boundaries as background. Results will be a little lower in precision, however, substantially higher in recall, run time may be increased a bit
%   smooth: if 1, instead of the original eigenvector square as saliency map, takes the absolute, which produces less sharper saliency masks
%
%   Output:
%   SalMap: Saliency map
